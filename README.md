This Library Management System is made to help manage the library in a college. In our college, students and staff have their own IDs, and there are different courses like engineering, M.Tech, and diploma. I got the idea to make this system to keep track of books, who borrows them, and who returns them.

I used MySQL Workbench to create the database. The database has tables for Books, Students, Staff, and Loans. I added primary and foreign keys to connect the tables and keep the data correct. This system helps to manage the library easily and makes sure everything is organized.
